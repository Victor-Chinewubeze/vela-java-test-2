# Unbabel Java Challenge

Hey :smile:

Welcome to our Java Challenge repository. This README will guide you on how to participate in this challenge.

**Please fork this repo before you start working on the challenge.** We will evaluate the code on the fork.

**FYI:** There are no right and wrong answers. This is just an opportunity for us both to work together and get to know each other in a more technical way.

## Challenge

#### Web Application in JAVA

##### Intro

In this repo you will find a sample project with Spring-boot using MVC pattern.
You are recommended to use this sample, but if you wish to build on another platform or from scratch, surprise us (recent tecnologies please)!

In the sample project you will find:

* Java 8
* Spring Boot
* Thymeleaf template engine
* H2 Database

##### Running sample Project 

To run the example: `mvn spring-boot:run` and go to http://localhost:8080

To run tests on the example:
`mvn test`

##### Specification

Build a web application in Java composed by a page with 1 input text field, 1 picklist field, 1 button and 1 output text area:

1. **Input text field: “Text to translate:”**
	To introduce the text to be translated.
 
2.  **Picklist field: “Translate to:”**
Must present a list of languages to translate. (you can check the supported languages in the Unbabel website).
 
3.  **Button: “Submit”**
Should submit the text to our API (link in Resources) in order to be translated. (Be aware that you must check when the Response Status is completed).
 
4.  **Five column table with:**
“From Language, Original Text, To Language, Translated Text, Status".
Should present all the translations already made.
 
You can add images/fields/buttons as you seem fit. 
 
Translations must be done using the Unbabel API in sandbox mode. (Ask whoever has been in contact with you about the credentials).

##### Tests
You are required to create tests for your application, however you'r not required to have high code coverage. We prefer various types of testing (Unit, Integration, Mocks etc...).


##### Documentation
You must also do a document **"Application Technical Scope"**  with:
* Use cases
* Data Model
* Class Diagram
* Sequence Diagram (Communication with Unbabel API)

Add as a pdf in the repository.

#### Requirements
* Create a scalable application.
* Only use Unbabel's Translation API on sandbox mode

#### Resources
* Unbabel's API: http://developers.unbabel.com/
* Spring Boot guides: https://spring.io/guides
